Four methods for writing in a file:
 -> open() 
 -> read() 
 -> write()
 -> close() 

Opening a File

	fd = open(name, flags, mode)

	fd -> returns lowest available descriptor
	name -> pathname of the file to be opened
	flags -> must include  one of O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR
		-> may include one or more of: o_APPEND, O_CREAT, O_TRUNC
	mode -> Access mode of the file (only used if the file is being created

Standard Streams
		(keyboard) fd = 0 -> stdin
		(Program) fd = 1 -> stdout -> Screen
		(Program) fd = 2 -> stderr -> Screen


Writing to file from data memory
	write(fd, buffer, count)

Reading from file to data memory
	read(fd, buffer, count)
	-> read returns the number  of bytes actually read (0 or zero on end-of-file)

Closing a File
	close(fd) -> closes the descriptor and makes it available for resuse
	fd -> an open file descriptor
